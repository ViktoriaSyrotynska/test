            <p>It’s hard find the words to describe a man that the football world known simply as ‘The GOAT’. Born in Rosario, the Argentine crossed the Atlantic at just 13 years of age to join FC Barcelona. 21 years later, the famous left foot has dribbled its way to Paris Saint-Germain, for the biggest challenge of his career.</p>
            <p>In between, ‘Leo’ has scaled all the heights. Messi has won 4 Champions League, 10 Liga titles, 7 Copa del Rey, 6 European Golden Boots, an Olympic gold medal and lifted the Copa America with Argentina, just before landing in the French capital. The all-time leading goal scorer for his country, the top scorer in the history of Spanish football, the top assist provider in the 21st century, Messi has broken all the records, but above all, inspired an entire generation of footballers around the world with his genius. A living legend, ‘La Pulga’ has won 6 Ballons d’Or, and will now continue his remarkable career in Rouge et Bleu.</p>
